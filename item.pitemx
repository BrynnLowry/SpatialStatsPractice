Communities plant trees in an effort to reduce summer peak \ntemperatures, improve air quality, reduce stormwater run-off, enhance \nproperty values, provide wildlife habitat and strengthen social \nconnections in neighborhoods.   If a community can understand the extent\n and location of its existing tree canopy, then it can design and \nimplement sound management practices to maximize those services by \nprioritizing locations for tree planting efforts, establishing urban \nforestry master plans and sustainability plans, and managing threats to \ncanopy loss. The map viewer also highlights population and environmental\n characteristics that can help identify communities disproportionately \nburdened by risks that urban tree cover may help ameliorate.<\/div><div><br /> <\/div><div>California\u2019s\n urban tree canopy covers 15% of the urban areas and contains an \nestimated 173 million trees.  The annual value of ecosystem services \nfrom these trees has been estimated at $8.3. billion and the urban \nforest asset has been valued  at $181 billion (McPherson, E., et al \n2017).<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>The tree canopy layer was created by \nEarthDefine, LLC, under contract with the USDA Forest Service and the \nCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE). The\n layers representing population and environmental characteristics were \nderived from CalEnviroScreen 3.0 (Office of Environmental Health Hazard \nAssessment) and calculations of the Urban Heat Island Index were generated by the \nCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency.<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>This interactive map contains the following layers<\/div><div><br /><\/div><div>\u2022   \n 2012 Urban Tree Canopy- generated by EarthDefine, LLC from 2012 \nNational Agriculture Imagery Program aerial imagery which included four \nspectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared).
